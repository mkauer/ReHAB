 ReHAB --> Reconstruction HPSS Assistance to Batchfarm
=======================================================

10.10.19
+ RECO_LEVEL=0 is now for ONLY downloading the files
- deleted function bbftpDownload2farm{}
+ feb03-jul10.runs
~ configReco.sh was updated
~ nemo3-env.sh was updated

10.07.06
~ in function 'createNemor' changed the MCFILE to point
  to a shorter pathname to avoid 80 char limit.

10.05.21
~ changed the BBFTP 'get' command to cchpssnemo.in2p3.fr:/hpss/...
+ MotherReco.pl now has a -help option

09.08.06
+ mother_reco.pl has matching options now
~ nemorLog() now checks the JUMP to TOTAL events
~ $recobunch = 250000 and $bunches = 4

09.08.05
~ cleanStr() removes all weird formats within a string
  including \f \a \e \r \n
~ status.pl has -D option to remove files with a JUMP
  that is larger than the total number of MC events
~ hpssPath() now makes filedir if it doesn't exist
+ nemorLog() function looks for common errors in nemor.log
+ firstEvent() returns the 'JUMP' event number
+ procEvent() returns the number of events processed
~ errRoot() checks nemor.log instead of file size
~ errDST() checks nemor.log instead of file size
~ status.pl prints out detailed nemor.log errors now
+ cleanStr() to remove formatting at beginning and end of string
  for example, some lines in nemor.log have a \r
+ size() prints out the size of a file after checking that
  the exists

09.07.15
+ made scripts require perl v5.8.5
+ bbftp downloads stop after 3 retries
~ ssh to pc122 now happens before the bbftp downloads so
  only one connection is created for all downloads instead
  of having one connection for every download
+ more thorough status checks are now done, but still not
  looking through all logfiles as that would take too long
~ change error check output format so that a return 0 means
  a successful check, ie no errors
+ functions errDST(), errRaw(), statusID()
+ function noWS() to remove white spaces on strings
~ all string manip functions use noWS() to make sure strings
  are read correctly because there was some trouble with this
~ rebuild the whole status.pl script to use recoMod.pm
+ made $bbftpdir,$cmddir,$logdir,$rawdir,$scriptdir public
~ many other minor fixes to other functions

09.07.08
+ bbftp_reco now pipes a file to ./tmp_bbftp/$USER-current.log
  so that you can see in real-time what it's doing
+ sticky permissions on the $basedir and ./tmp_dirs
~ modified perm() to put sticky on directories
+ added $RECO_LEVEL variable, see configReco for description.
  basically you can select to only reconstruct files that
  are being downloaded or only reconstruct files that are
  already downloaded. gives some flexibility to the user.
~ changed mother_reco to use the new $RECO_LEVEL.
~ major bufix to statBBFTP() as it wasn't returning the
  correct status number for files.
+ added function status().

09.07.07
+ new functions added, readDir(),file2array(),statRoot(),
  and statBBFTP().
+ statRoot() checks the status of the rootfiles
+ statBBFTP() checks the status of the downloaded file
~ mother,child,bbftp scripts now use the status checks
+ dos2unix when reading in a file, because the ssh.log
  files seem to have a weird bug.

09.07.06
+ a file 'RUNNING' is created while the reconstruction
  is running, so other scripts will know that ReHAB is
  currently working on that file.
~ changed how the permissions is handled in perm()
+ permtmp() function to change all permissions of tmp dirs

09.07.03
+ status outputs success efficiency
~ changed permR() line to [a-zA-Z0-9]
+ child_reco outputs its total runtime
+ bbftp_reco outputs downloads left to do if re-submitting
~ ReHAB won't recontruct a file if the *.dst > 50k
  i'll make this more intelligent in the future
~ increased the truncation of the hpss.path

09.07.02
+ bbftp_reco will re-submit itself to batch farm
  it will keep re-submitting until all downloads finish
~ bbftp_reco is sent to 'medium' farm now
  'medium' farm has more priority over 'long' farm
+ $PERL5LIB variable added to configReco.sh
  perl looks here for user modules ie 'recoMod.pm'
+ added function 'hpssPath' to recoMod.pm
  generates hpss.path file with truncated hpss path
+ added function 'subSplit' to recoMod.pm
  string manipulation to get sub-strings
+ hpss.path file with truncated path sent to each reco directory
  to be used later by a script to move good root files
~ modified the test_reco to take runlists for testing funtions
