 ReHAB --> Reconstruction HPSS Assistance to Batchfarm
=======================================================

is a collection of scripts whose purpose is to take a list
of files the user wants to reconstruct from the hpss server,
and download those files and reconstruct them, all done 
automatically via the batchfarm.

mother_reco.pl and configReco.sh are the only two
scripts the user must be aware of.

configReco.sh --> has global variables that all other
  scripts will be using so make sure these are correct
  and then you must 'source configReco.sh'

mother_reco.pl --> is the main script. it takes any 
  number of listfiles as arguments.

./mother_reco.pl 2b2n.list bi214.list tl208.list etc...

-------------------------------------------------------

listfiles are generally of the type 'name.list' mainly
for identification purposes but ReHAB does not actually
care about the '.list' suffix.

the format for the entries in your listfile is very 
flexible. please see the 'example.list' for a more
detailed demonstration.
